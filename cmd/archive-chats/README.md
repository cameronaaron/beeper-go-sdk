## Features in Detail

### Interactive Selection
The tool displays all your chats with:
- Chat title (truncated to 40 chars)
- Network type (Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Participant count
- Unread message count (if any)

### Progress Indicators
For large chats (500+ messages), progress updates are shown:
```
[1/5] Archiving: Team Standup
  ‚Üí Fetched 500 messages...
  ‚Üí Fetched 1000 messages...
   ‚úì Archived to: 2025-10-07_instagram_team-standup.md

- Truncated titles (max 50 chars)

### Markdown Features
- Properly escaped special characters
- Block quotes for message text
- Multi-line messages preserved
- File size formatting (KB, MB, GB)
- Clean separator lines

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Beeper Desktop running locally
- Valid access token

## Tips

- Archive chats regularly to preserve history
- Add `chat-archives/` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing private exports
- Large chats may take a few minutes to fetch all messages
- Archives can be viewed in any markdown viewer or editor

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to create client"**
- Make sure `BEEPER_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set
- Verify Beeper Desktop is running

**"Failed to fetch chats"**
- Check your network connection
- Verify your access token is valid
- Make sure Beeper Desktop API is accessible

**Large chats timing out**
- The tool has a 30-second timeout per request
- For very large chats, consider archiving fewer at once

## License

Same as the main Beeper Desktop API project.
